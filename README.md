# 7DTD Webmap Annotations
As of the latest build of 7 Days to Die (A10.4 b10), the included user game map is lacking somewhat in usefulness. To aid in this, gamer/dev Alloc created a dedicated server extension which adds in functionality to create a webmap with the game's map tileset. While an improvement, this tool is also lacking in some nice-to-have features. This script extends on that tool and allows a user with Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey installed to locally add notes to the map for locations, points of interest, etc.

## Requirements
Usage of this script presumes you are doing the following:
  * Running the latest version of Alloc's Dedicated Server Fixes (https://7dtd.illy.bz/wiki/Server%20fixes) on your 7 Days to Die server
  * Have a browser new enough to support local storage (this shouldn't be a problem for anyone, though)
  * Install the Greasemonkey (Firefox) or Tampermonkey (Chrome) extension in your web browser

## Installation
  1. (optional) You may need or want to change the `@include` path in the header of the script to more specifically point to your 7DTD server. This is probably only necessary if you visit other sites that use a URL formed as `/static/index.html`
  2. Open up Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey and import the script
  3. Disco
